We use Artificial Intelligence - AI to help UNICEF identify unmapped schools in Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Niger, Honduras, Ghana, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as part of UNICEF's Giga project. We identified 23,100 new unmapped schools.

During 7 months, We built an end-to-end scalable AI model pipeline:

## Generating training data using high-resolution images (super-tiles) from Maxar- Training dataset and sorting them in Google Cloud storage.

## Developing an efficient model training and experiments - GKE Cluster.

## Running detections models in more than 70 million images(tiles)- ML Enabler.
