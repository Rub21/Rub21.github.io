Mapping potential risks of human-wildlife conflicts. at Development Seed together with Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI). Weâ€™ve developed an AI-assisted survey method to map wildlife and human distributions and to detect potential conflict areas between wildlife and the human-associated activity for Tanzania.

Supporting this project in almost all the steps has been an amazing experience for me. Many thanks [Zhuang-Fang Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuang-fang-yi-phd-%E4%BE%9D%E5%BA%84%E9%98%B2-01178a34/), for all Artificial Intelligence mentoring sessions that I got, and Thanks to [Lane Goodman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanegoodman/) for a beautiful design that I used for visualizing the AI predictions on the map [https://ai4earth-wildlife-web.surge.sh/](https://ai4earth-wildlife-web.surge.sh/).
