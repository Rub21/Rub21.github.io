# AI-Assisted Risk Mapping for Human-Wildlife Conflicts in Tanzania

In collaboration with the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), we at Development Seed have devised an AI-powered survey methodology. This innovative approach maps both wildlife and human distributions in Tanzania, helping to pinpoint areas of potential conflict between the two.

## My Journey on This Project

Being involved in nearly every facet of this impactful project has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I extend my deepest gratitude to [Zhuang-Fang Yi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuang-fang-yi-phd-%E4%BE%9D%E5%BA%84%E9%98%B2-01178a34/) for invaluable mentorship in Artificial Intelligence. A special thank you also goes to [Lane Goodman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanegoodman/) for his exquisite design work, which I utilized to visualize our AI predictions on this [interactive map](https://ai4earth-wildlife-web.surge.sh/).
