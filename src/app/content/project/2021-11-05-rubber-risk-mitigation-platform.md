# Rubber Risk Mitigation Platform

The rubber risk mitigation platform, developed to back the Guidelines for Sustainable Development of Natural Rubber, is spearheaded by the CCCMC and supported by Development Seed. The platform involves extensive data â€“ from gigabytes of raster and vector data layers pertaining to risks to millions of Sentinel-2 satellite images, utilized to map rubber plantations in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam using machine learning. The platform's foundation is React, with Python scripts employed to process and adapt data for the dashboard.

The dashboard is designed to support both English and Chinese languages and additionally generates various reports based on the selected administrative boundaries.
