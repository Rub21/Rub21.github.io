# DS-annotate

DS-Annote is a cutting-edge tool that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for the annotation of machine learning training data. The application employs a customized SAM backend, specifically engineered to predict detections in satellite imagery and generate vector datasets from these predictions. I have crafted front-end functionalities to facilitate efficient and user-friendly interactions for the creation of segmentation and mapping data.
