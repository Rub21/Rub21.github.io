# Super Tiles


Super Tiles is a script designed to accept vector data inputs, either points or polygons, and identify the corresponding tile at a specified zoom level that overlays this vector data. In addition to generating the primary tile, the script also analyzes adjacent tiles to offer a more comprehensive context. As a result, Super Tiles produces 'enhanced tiles,' which include these additional surrounding tiles. These enhanced tiles are available in various resolutions, such as 512, 2024, and 2048 pixels. This functionality is particularly useful for creating training datasets that require more contextual information than a single tile can offer.
