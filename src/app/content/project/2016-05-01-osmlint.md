# OSMLint: OpenStreetMap Data Validation Made Easy

## Overview

OSMLint is a robust validation tool designed to ensure the integrity and quality of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Built on the TileReduce framework, OSMLint aims to identify a range of issues within the OSM dataset, thus helping maintainers, mappers, and users in improving the data. The tool leverages OSM QA Tiles for comprehensive validation.

## Features

- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large datasets without compromising on performance.
- **Modular**: Built with a focus on modularity, allowing you to customize the validation process.
- **Comprehensive**: Validates OSM QA Tiles against a wide array of pre-set validation rules.


## Dependencies

- TileReduce: The core framework upon which OSMLint operates.
- OSM QA Tiles: The QA tiles that serve as the basis for all validations.

## How It Works

OSMLint uses TileReduce to read in OSM QA Tiles and run them against a set of validation rules. These rules can be extended or modified to fit specific validation needs. 

The validation results are then presented in a structured output format, allowing easy identification of issues that may need further attention.

## Installation

Please ensure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Then you can install OSMLint using:

```bash
npm install -g osmlint
```
