# Vectorizing color range to Geocoordinates

Vectorizing Color Range to Geocoordinates is a tool designed to vectorize data based on a specific color range. Initially created for generating segmentation data, this tool also serves as a foundation for future utilities. Once the image mask is optimized, the tool can convert it into geometric data, which can then be used for generating training datasets for machine learning applications.
