# OpenAQ data fetching


[OpenAQ-Fetch](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-fetch) is a Node.js script designed to fetch air quality data from multiple reporting sites, serving as a data ingestion pipeline for the OpenAQ project. The script includes an ingest mechanism that gathers global air quality measurements from various sources. This mechanism is set to run every 10 minutes, storing all unique measurements in a dedicated database.
