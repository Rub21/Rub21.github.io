# Web Application for Satellite-Image-Based Machine Learning Training Data

Our web application streamlines the process of creating high-quality training data for Machine Learning models using satellite imagery. The application operates in two main phases:

## Phase 1: Initial Data Collection with Label-Maker

The primary data source is [Label-Maker](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker), a tool designed to convert OpenStreetMap tags into a labeled dataset suitable for use in Machine Learning projects.

## Phase 2: Data Refinement with Relabeler

The Relabeler component of our application focuses on data cleaning. It provides functionalities to review, correct, and validate the initial labels, ensuring that the final dataset is of optimal quality for Machine Learning training.
