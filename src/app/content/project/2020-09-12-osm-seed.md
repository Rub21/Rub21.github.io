But the OSM infrastructure has many complex components, At DevSeed we bring up the complex architecture of OpenStreetMap into docker containers and for starting up the complex infrastructure we just need a command line such as:

- `docker-compose up` in docker
- `helm install...` in kubernetes

This project it is been using for other organization to spring up their OSM mapping platform with their own resources, Take a look on the basic diagran:

Project that use use osm-seed:

- [https://openhistoricalmap.org/(https://openhistoricalmap.org/)
- DevSeed data-team use the mapping platform for their own mapping projects

There were more other organizations that I am aware of them.
