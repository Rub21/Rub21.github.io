# Simplifying OpenStreetMap Infrastructure with Docker at DevSeed

Navigating the complex architecture of OpenStreetMap (OSM) can be daunting. At DevSeed, we've streamlined this intricate ecosystem by containerizing it using Docker. This enables organizations to deploy their own OSM mapping platforms with minimal hassle.

## Effortless Startup with a Single Command

Starting up the entire OSM infrastructure is now as easy as running a single command line:

- For Docker: `docker-compose up`
- For Kubernetes: `helm install...`

## Real-World Applications: Who's Using OSM-Seed?

Several organizations are leveraging our OSM-Seed project to deploy their mapping platforms, including but not limited to:

- [Open Historical Map](https://openhistoricalmap.org/)
- DevSeed's Data Team for their internal mapping projects

I'm aware of even more organizations that have adopted this solution.
