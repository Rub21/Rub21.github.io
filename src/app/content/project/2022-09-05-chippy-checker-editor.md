# Chippy Checker Editor

The "Chippy Checker Editor" is a QGIS plugin aimed at reviewing and editing chips and their corresponding label-geojson files, specifically to prepare data for machine learning model training. The plugin needs access to four directories: a 'Records' directory for storing administrative files, a 'Chips' directory for the chips to be reviewed, an 'Input Label' directory for the original label-geojson files, and an 'Output Label' directory for the edited files.


The plugin is hosted in a private repository for more secure and private use. Following this, sample GIFs are displayed to demonstrate how the plugin works.
