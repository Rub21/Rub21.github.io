I serve as an Infrastructure Developer in OpenHistoricalMap project, which is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and utilizes Kubernetes for orchestrating Docker containers. For those interested in the technical details, the source code is publicly available on GitHub. 

You can find it in these repositories: [Development Seed's OSM Seed](https://github.com/developmentseed/osm-seed) and [Open Historical Map's OHM Deploy](https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/ohm-deploy).

Together with my Peruvian colleagues, we've added an elaborate map of the Inca Empire, known as Tahuantinsuyo, as well as the Inca roads, to the platform. To achieve this, we reprojected selected images using Python and integrated the data using the JOSM editor. This information is now publicly accessible.
