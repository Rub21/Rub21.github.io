# Kenya GHG Emissions Dashboard
Climate change is an increasingly important factor in Kenya's path to sustainable development. To enhance its ability to prioritize interventions, track progress, and monitor impact, Kenya has established an integrated Monitoring, Reporting and Verification.

(MRV+) Framework. The MRV+ Framework is designed to enhance transparency and accountability, facilitate tracking of climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, monitor Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, facilitate reporting, and enhance
awareness of climate change issues and actions.

The national GHG Inventory is a core component of Kenya's overall MRV+ Framework. In line with IPCC requirements, and in keeping with Kenya's commitment to transparency and reporting under the Paris Agreement, the GHG Inventory Dashboard
highlights Kenya's GHG emissions across four sectors - 1) Agriculture, Forestry, and Land Use (AFOLU), 2) Energy and Transport,
3) Industrial Processes and Products use (IPPU), and 4) Waste. The Dashboard summarizes results from the National GHG
Inventory Report and is coordinated by the Climate Change Directorate (CCD) under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
