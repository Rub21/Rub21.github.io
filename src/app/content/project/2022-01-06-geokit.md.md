# Geokit

GeoKit is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool developed in JavaScript, Python, and Java. It serves as a centralized repository for various scripts that we have created at Development Seed. Over time, we've written numerous scripts for different projects, and some of these scripts are reused across multiple projects. To streamline this process, we decided to centralize these scripts into a single tool that supports multiple environments, including JavaScript, Python, and Java. This makes it easier for anyone who wants to use GeoKit for data processing to access and implement these scripts.
