# FloodWatch: Empowering Communities to Navigate Safely During Floods

FloodWatch is a web application that serves as a real-time reporting and navigation assistant during flood events. It enables neighbors to report flooded streets, which are then reviewed and validated by municipal managers. Once verified, the application provides alternate routes to help residents and commuters avoid the flooded areas.

## Key Features:

### Real-Time Reporting
Community members can report flooding in their area, providing critical data to both the municipality and their neighbors.

### Validation by Municipal Managers
Reports are reviewed and authenticated by municipal authorities to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### Dynamic Route Suggestion
Once the data is validated, the application offers alternate routes for safe circulation, avoiding the flood-affected streets.
